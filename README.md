# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my first project from scratch.

The project is to simulate a game of tic-tac-toe where the players switch from X and O via clicking, and the game ends once a player wins or there is a tie.

script.js contains all of the final code, and scriptLong.js contains all of the code I tried, commented, refactored, etc.
