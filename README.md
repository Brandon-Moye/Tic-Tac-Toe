# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my first project from scratch. You can play it here: https://brandon-moye.github.io/

The project is to simulate a game of tic-tac-toe where the players switch from X and O via clicking, and the game ends once a player wins or there is a tie.

I heavily used querySelector and addEventListener to trigger functions and lines of code to operate under certain conditions so the game could be played.
Each time there was a click on a game tile, that trigged the code to change the game piece to an X or O, the opposite of the player who just placed a game piece. This functionality was achieved by using if statements.
Once a player won, a message card appeared so no player could continue to click on the game. 
If players wanted to have a rematch the reset button appeared after a player won, or all available tiles were filled and there was a tie.

script.js contains all of the final code, and scriptLong.js contains all of the code I tried, commented, refactored, etc.
